# female-fronted-metal

I used to keep this on [last.fm](https://last.fm) until they [killed journals](https://www.last.fm/user/tecknicaltom/journal/2010/02/17/3fb6qq_my_list_of_female_fronted_metal). For now it's just a copy/paste of what I had there (including their old bb-like markup), until I clean it up to be usable here.

---

So this is my list of [female fronted metal](https://www.last.fm/tag/female+fronted+metal). It's mostly for my benefit, but hopefully others can get some use of it too. Some things worth mentioning:

* All opinions here are mine and just opinions. If you disagree with my opinions, don't bother telling me so in a comment.
* If however, I've missed somebody, recommendations in the comments are more than welcome.
* Some bands on my list may be closer to hard rock or alternative than metal on the continuum.
* I'm putting bands that I think are too symphonic/gothic/opera metal in a separate section. This isn't a statement about their quality, they're just not my goal for this list.
* Bands listed are not necessarily in any order.

[Otep](https://last.fm/artist/Otep) - I have to admit that I like their first album better than all of their later albums, but they're still worth a listen to.[img]http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/_/4464005/Otep+_web1.jpg[/img]

## The Dislikes
[Arch Enemy](https://last.fm/artist/Arch Enemy) - Too death metal for my tastes
[In This Moment](https://last.fm/artist/In This Moment) - The lead singer's voice has always irritated me
[System Divide](https://last.fm/artist/System Divide) - The separation of the female vocalist's mellow sections and the male vocalist's death metal makes this sound like a weird remix of two bands, neither of which is amazing
[Amaranthe](https://last.fm/artist/Amaranthe) - too pop metal, female vocalist only does clean vocals
[Roses Unread](https://last.fm/artist/Roses Unread) - more beauty & beast

## The Symphonic/Gothic Metal
Again, I have no comment about how good or bad any of these bands are. I'm mainly listing them here because they are often listed as female fronted metal but they're not what I'm looking for.
